    "readme": "→ Selectize is looking for [new members on the maintenance team](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/issues/752)!\n\n# selectize.js\n\n[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/selectize.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/selectize)\n[![CDNJS version](http://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/selectize.js.svg?style=flat)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/selectize.js)\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/selectize/selectize.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/selectize/selectize.js)\n[![Coverage Status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/selectize/selectize.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://coveralls.io/r/selectize/selectize.js)\n\nSelectize is an extensible [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)-based custom &lt;select&gt; UI control. It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. It clocks in at around ~7kb (gzipped). The goal is to provide a solid & usable experience with a clean and powerful API.\n\n- [Demos](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/releases)\n- [Examples](examples/)\n- [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md)\n- [API Documentation](docs/api.md)\n- [Plugin Documentation](docs/plugins.md)\n- [Browser Test Matrix](https://saucelabs.com/u/selectize)\n\n### Features\n\n- **Smart Option Searching / Ranking**<br>Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js)). Want to search an item's title *and* description? No problem.\n- **Caret between items**<br>Order matters sometimes. Use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow keys to move between selected items.</li>\n- **Select &amp; delete multiple items at once**<br>Hold down <kbd>option</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows to select more than one item to delete.\n- **Díåcritîçs supported**<br>Great for international environments.\n- **Item creation**<br>Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).\n- **Remote data loading**<br>For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.\n- **Clean API &amp; code**<br>Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests welcome!\n- **Extensible**<br> [Plugin API](docs/plugins.md) for developing custom features (uses [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js)).\n- **Touch Support**<br> Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (1.7 and greater)\n- [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js) (bundled in [\"standalone\" build](dist/js/standalone))\n- [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js) (bundled in [\"standalone\" build](dist/js/standalone))\n\n### Installation and files\n\nAll pre-built files needed to use Selectize can be found in the\n[\"dist\"](dist/) folder.\n\nIf you're looking to get started with minimal fuss, include\n`standalone/selectize.min.js` (bundles Sifter and Microplugin\ndependencies – also available un-minified for debugging, just remove the\n`.min` part) and `css/selectize.default.css`.\n\nSelectize is available at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/selectize.js).\n\n- [**js/**](dist/js)\n\t- [**standalone/**](dist/js/standalone)\n\t\t- [selectize.js](dist/js/standalone/selectize.js) — With dependencies, minus jquery\n\t- [selectize.js](dist/js/selectize.js) — Without dependencies\n- [**less/**](dist/less)\n\t- [selectize.less](dist/less/selectize.less) — Core styles\n\t- [selectize.default.less](dist/less/selectize.default.less) — Default theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap2.less](dist/less/selectize.bootstrap2.less) — Bootstrap 2 theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap3.less](dist/less/selectize.bootstrap3.less) — Bootstrap 3 theme\n\t- [**plugins/**](dist/less/plugins) — Individual plugin styles\n- [**css/**](dist/css)\n\t- [selectize.css](dist/css/selectize.css) — Core styles\n\t- [selectize.default.css](dist/css/selectize.default.css) — Default theme (with core styles)\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap2.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap2.css) - Bootstrap 2 theme\n\t- [selectize.bootstrap3.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap3.css) - Bootstrap 3 theme\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\n$('select').selectize(options);\n```\n\nThe available options are [documented here](docs/usage.md).\n\n#### IE8 Support\n\nTo support Internet Explorer 8, [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/) must be added your page.\n\n```html\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script src=\"http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/2.0.8/es5-shim.min.js\"></script><![endif]-->\n```\n\n### Custom Builds\n\nBy default, all [plugins](src/plugins) are included. To hand-pick what plugins (if any) to include, run [`grunt`](http://gruntjs.com/) with the \"--plugins\" flag. After this completes, grab the files you need from the [\"dist\"](dist) folder.\n\n```sh\n# dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# build selectize\ngrunt --plugins=\ngrunt --plugins=*\ngrunt --plugins=remove_button,restore_on_backspace\n```\n\n### Contributing\nWhen issuing a pull request:\n\n* please **do not include/commit changes in the `dist/` folder** to avoid\n  merge conflicts.  A good way to include the right files is to use\n  `git gui` or `git add` when committing to select the files you want to\n  add to your commit.\n\n* please **include tests** with your feature so that we're not tempted to\n  break it in the future!\n\nAdd an entry to the top of the CHANGELOG, and update the documentation\nin `docs/` as needed. (Refactors and documentation changes don't need a\nchangelog entry.)\n\nSquash your commits together in one or a few complete, logical commits,\nwith a concise and descriptive message. One commit means one\nfeature/bugfix/thing that has changed, or a diff bringing the code one\nstep forward to a better, working state.\n\nOnce your commit is nice and clean, and you want to *discard the other\nchanges*, you can use `git checkout .` (that will erase changes to\ntracked files) and `git clean [-i/--interactive]` (to erase untracked\nfiles).  **However, be careful with those commands, as their function\nis to erase things/changes.**\n\n\n#### Tests\nPlease ensure all the tests pass:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test # phantomjs\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox npm test\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome npm test\n$ BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome,Safari npm test\n```\n\n#### Local environment\nTo run Selectize locally:\n\n```sh\n$ npm start\n```\n\nYou can then run the examples in `http://localhost:8000/examples/`.\n\nHowever, be careful not to add the `dist/` files in your commit, as\nGrunt automatically regenerates the files in `dist/` as the source is\nchanged.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2013–2016 [Brian Reavis](http://twitter.com/brianreavis) & [Contributors](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/graphs/contributors)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
